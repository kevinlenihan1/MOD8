# MOD8
Portfolio for CS210
This project is the module 2 assignment for a calculator
It takes two numbers and an operator and applies the operator to those numbers
I think the program is fine for what it is, it does not need to be more efficient or secure seeing as there is only one file and more files would be unnecesary
This was my first use of a switch case which was difficult to do at first but once I figured it out via online resources I think it functioned exceptionally well
The biggest thing from this project will be the usage of a switch case, there are many other uses for something like this in various different projects
This program has inline comments and plenty of whitespace to help the viewer read and udnerstand what is going on
